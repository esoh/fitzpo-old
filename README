This backend service requires:

npm (node)
mongodb

Directions for testing:

Install node packages:
npm install

Run server:
npm start





Run the mongodb service locally.
MAC:
brew services start mongodb

Notes:
"npm start" calls "node app", as defined in package.json.

The "main" is set to "app.js" as our entry point at npm initilalization.

npm is the node js package handler.

nodemon allows us to make changes without having to rerun the service manually.

express is a popular node framework that allows for less code and effort.

mongoose translates objects in code to objects in mongodb.

bcrypt is encryption.

cors specifies the handling of cross-origin requests (requests from different
origins than the app), specifying who can request and which requests are
allowed from them. Without it, the app cannot access resources from other
domains.
Locally, it allows us to make requests from front end even if it's on a
different port.

jsonwebtoken (JWT) is used as an authentication token that is generated from
authentication, and is used for API calls by authenticated users.

body-parser parses requests.

passport handles the success/failure of authenticating requests. It can provide
for persistent logins, authenticate requests, verify passwords, and more.
passport-jwt uses a login strategy with json web tokens.
